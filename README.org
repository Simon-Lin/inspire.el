inspire.el is an Emacs interface for literature and references searching on the high energy article database [[https://inspirehep.net][inspirehep]].

* Common usage
inspire.el provides two main entry functions for searching on [[https://inspirehep.net][inspirehep]]: \\
~inspire-literature-search~ for literature lookup, and ~inspire-author-search~ for author lookup. \\
The [[https://help.inspirehep.net/knowledge-base/inspire-paper-search/][SPIRES syntax]] is available for ~inspire-literature-search~ function.
inspire.el will then pop-up a list of records where one can browse and examine detailed information for each record.


In the record list, use ~n~ and ~p~ to navigate through the list. \\
Other useful commands and their default bindings:
+ ~u (inspire-open-url)~ : open the web page associated to the item
+ ~d (inspire-download-pdf)~: download PDF from a selected source
+ ~b (inspire-export-bibtex-new-buffer)~: export the bibTeX entry to a temporary buffer
+ ~B (inspire-export-bibtex-to-file)~: export the bibtex entry to a .bib file
+ ~e (inspire-download-pdf-export-bibtex)~: download PDF and export bibTeX info to a file
+ ~a (inspire-record-author-lookup)~: look up for a author profile in current record 
+ ~r (inspire-reference-search)~: look up for references of the current record 
+ ~c (inspire-citation-search)~: look up for citations of the current record 
+ ~[ (inspire-previous-search)~,  ~] (inspire-next-search)~: navigate through the search history
+ ~q (inspire-exit)~: exit the record list

Some texts in the record or author information buffer are clickable and will preform corresponding action when clicked upon.

* Customization
Various options of inspire.el are located in the customize group named ~inspire~. You can also set the variables directly:
** faces
To make the display faces use monospace fonts:
#+begin_src elisp
  (setq inspire-use-variable-pitch nil)
#+end_src
You can also set the relevant faces (faces start with ~inspire-~) directly.
** using new frames
To not pop up a new frame when initiating a new inspire query:
#+begin_src elisp
  (setq inspire-pop-up-new-frame nil)
#+end_src
The new frame parameter is set by the variable ~inspire-frame-alist~.
** download folder
To change the default download folder for papers:
#+begin_src elisp
  (setq inspire-default-download-folder "/some/other/directory/")
#+end_src
** master bibfile
To change the default bibTeX file that functions ~inspire-export-bibtex-to-file~ and ~inspire-download-pdf-export-bibtex~ point to:
#+begin_src elisp
  (setq inspire-master-bibliography-file "/your/preferred_file.bib")
#+end_src
To use absolute paths for pdf links when exporting bibTeX entries:
#+begin_src elisp
  (setq inspire-pdf-use-absolute-path t)
#+end_src
** pdf view function
To change the default pdf viewing function, set the variable ~inspire-pdf-open-function~ accordingly.
